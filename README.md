    ---WEBSITE MILESTONE BRAINSTORMING---

    What is the goal of the website and what problem is it trying to solve

    Discuss the achitecture needed to support the website and its functionality

    The website needs to accomodate an arrangement of companies similar to Alibabas 
    portal

    IDEA: MealPlanner and Health Management
        alabolration and the project breif will need to be created to spec

    Design for the users not the owner!

    Audience Defintion needs to be revisted as the project develops

    ---More Detailed look at the website Concept---

    The website is a Meal Planner that uses express and vue to pass data around the website. This means a jsnode platform will be required to host.
    This website will sell a service as a product which is the ability to store and manage information in relation to a persons specific dietry requirements and needs.
    The user will have a private section of the website where they can add remove and edit text and content areas on a calendar type interface. The Calander will be linked to a users current inventory or grocery list that the user can also add remove and edit items that they aquire at the supermarket etc. "A virtual cupboard" of sorts. 

    A user can scan products for keywords that could be implemented with a mobile camera feature so that a user can simple take a photo of the item, also possibly use pictures of the product front and back to ensure that the user gets all the information they need from the ingredients etc. The user will then save this new product as an item in thier inventory and the amount that was purchased. Expiry information etc can be attached to the product to warn the user that these specific items are nearing their expiry date and require to be used or replaced at the supermarket

    This platform will accomodate the user base of 2000 members that are registered in the facebook group "meat free mixing with mandy". This group requires a meal planning and dietry needs application and will also offer the ability for users to share thier specific meal plans and diets through a sharing portal similar to an auction house where users can display specific diets for others to use. 
    
    This is the fundemental idea to be created. The product is a service and instead of an auction house for physical items, a sharing portal of valued information will be instantiated 

    As the platform requires some sort of auction
